"""
General Adversarial Inverse Learning (GAIL)

The original GAIL paper describes the following main components of their algorithm:
1) input expert trajectories, an initial policy, and discriminator parameters
2) train by:
 i) sampling trajectories from the input expert trajectories
 ii) compute a discriminator update
 iii) compute a policy update

Below, we will indicate which parts corresponds to which of these steps.
